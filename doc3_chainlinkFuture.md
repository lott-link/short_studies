As an AI language model, I don't have access to real-time information or insights into future developments. However, as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, Chainlink Version 2 (V2) was a widely used and supported version of the Chainlink oracle network.

It's important to note that blockchain technologies and protocols, including Chainlink, are subject to continuous development and improvements. New versions and updates are released to enhance functionality, security, and performance. While it is possible for newer versions to be introduced in the future, it doesn't necessarily mean that the previous version will be deprecated immediately or rendered obsolete.

The deprecation of a specific version of Chainlink or any other blockchain protocol typically depends on various factors, including the adoption rate of newer versions, community support, technical considerations, and backward compatibility requirements. The Chainlink team and community would communicate any significant changes or deprecations related to different versions, ensuring a smooth transition and providing ample time for developers and users to adapt to any updates.

To stay updated on the latest developments and version releases of Chainlink, it is recommended to follow official sources such as the Chainlink website, blog, or community channels for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
