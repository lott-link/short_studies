Hi, in the DAO doc, we found Aragon as the best tool to build our DAOs and there is no need to build an independent dapp. and also we tested the aragon dapp and realized that is easy to use. the only one more thing is that we need a dao dapp that makes standard smart contracts and if we made it, we would also can continue with the dapp in another dapp.

in the beginning of searches I found a list of 77 DAO tools introduced in alchemy website : https://www.alchemy.com/top/dao-tools

1. https://juicebox.money/create : it is a multipurpose DAO-tooling platform that enhances quick building and management of DAOs.  Juicebox was designed for DAOs that want to crowdfund or NFT projects that want to create a seamless community-building experience.  A lot of high-profile DAOs have sprung up from Juicebox, including the renowned Constitution DAO and Assange DAO. 

    - juice box only does support ethereum mainnnet
    - there is something interesting about juicebox such as NFTs but because of not supporting anything we ignore it.

2. https://www.tally.xyz/add-a-dao/governor : it is an extension of great compound project. Tally is a distinctive DAO tool that provides three custom solutions at once: a customizable payout system for use within and outside a DAO, an on-chain governance feature that facilitates voting, and the ability to recognize usernames (ENS) rather than needing to use addresses when contributing to DAOs.  By making it easier to govern, Tally hopes to spur on the growth and contributions of decentralized organizations and make better connections among their members. 

    - I think its even better than aragon.
    - supports a lot of chains including polygon and mumbai.
    - unfortunately it did not support the aragon dao!
    - the worse thing is that it does not deploy the dao contract by itself. we need to deploy a governance of openzeppelin on the network we want and add the contract address to tally.

3. https://boardroom.io/ : Boardroom is a DAO manager helping members make faster, smarter, and more informed decisions

4. https://snapshot.org/#/ : Snapshot is a gasless decentralized voting protocol for DAOs. 

5. https://www.showkarma.xyz/ : DAOs and communities use our tools to get visibility into their member contributions and take actions to increase engagement and accountability.

6. https://www.sismo.io/ : Sismo is a modular attestation protocol focused on decentralization, privacy, and usability.

7. https://underdogprotocol.com/ : Underdog enables developers & projects to easily integrate dynamic NFTs into any product or workflow.
    - only solana

8. https://metopia.xyz/beta : Web3 infrastructure that creates a data-based user reputation system for governance and rewards.
    - supports ehtereum and polygon, smartchain and optimism. but not the testnets
    - does not support openzeppelin contracts

9. https://pnthn.xyz/ : Track DAO member reputations and establish credibility in the NFT space.
