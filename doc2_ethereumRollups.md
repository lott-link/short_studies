why the polygon is cheaper than arbitrum and optimism ?

there are a number of ethereum layer2 chains that they has claimed that they are rolling up the the transactions and sending to ethereum to be stored there by very lower gas fees.

but here is the question; if they are doing same job, why a simple transfer costs about 0.05$ on the polygon network, about 0.3$ on arbitrum and about 2$ on optimism network?
or perhaps they are basically different!

results:
Yes; they are different. accourding to the chat gpt informations, polygon is an independant side-chain network that holds the data in it. however the assets such as tokens and coins can be transfered crosschain through the pos-bridge.
the point is that transactions are not going to be submited on the ethereum directly and non-directly.
but how does arbitrum and optimism work? well they are a little more leyer2 than polygon. Arbitrum and optimism are using Optimistic Rollup technology to enhance scalability on Ethereum. in simple words, they are submiting a summary of the transaction on Ethereum.
If the entire Arbitrum ledger were to be destroyed, is it possible to recover all data from ethereum mainnet? 
not unfotunately, However, it's important to note that the Ethereum mainnet does store high-level information about the Optimistic Rollup chains, such as the state roots and relevant metadata. In the event of a catastrophic failure or destruction of the Arbitrum ledger.
If you deploy a smart contract on the Arbitrum network, it is not directly accessible on the Ethereum mainnet.

I found something that nearly explain why the polygon is lower in gas fees. something about the technology that they use and their different costs in storing data on ethereum mainnet. but the main reason is the choice of the network. it can offer desired gas prices and the polygon prefers to provide a cost-effective gas fee environment for users.
